# Nightclub-App

The NightClub App is an application that provides users, club owners, and DJs a one stop shop for all their club needs. For users, they are able to view clubs within their area and scope out which club they want to go to. Within each club page, users can view information such as hours of operation, special events, and more. In addition users are also able to make song requests and also book tables at a venue through this app. For Club Owners, they are able to display information, edit menu, view bookings for tables, and more. For DJs, they are able to view song requests and special announcements submitted by the DJs.

If you wish to run the app you will need to add your own Rapid and Google Map API key into local.properties as such:
MAPS_API_KEY="GOOGLE MAP KEY HERE"
RAPID_API_KEY="RAPID API KEY HERE"
